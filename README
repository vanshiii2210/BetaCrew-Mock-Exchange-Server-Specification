 Client Responsibilities Summary
Connect to Server

TCP connection on port 3000 (with provided host/IP).

Send Request (Binary Format)

callType (1 byte):

1 → Stream All Packets

2 → Resend Packet

resendSeq (1 byte):

Only used if callType = 2

Handle Responses

Each response packet is 17 bytes in Big Endian:

4 bytes: Symbol (ASCII)

1 byte: Buy/Sell ("B"/"S")

4 bytes: Quantity (int32)

4 bytes: Price (int32)

4 bytes: Packet Sequence (int32)

Check for Missing Packets

Collect all sequence numbers.

Detect any gaps in sequences (except last).

For each missing sequence, resend request with callType = 2 and that sequence number.

Best Practices

Handle disconnections/errors gracefully.

Always close the connection after “Resend Packet” requests.

Log issues and verify data integrity.
